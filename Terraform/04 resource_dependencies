In Terraform, resource dependencies control the order in which resources are created, updated, or destroyed. Terraform automatically infers dependencies based on references, but you can also define them manually.

 1. Implicit Dependencies (Recommended)
    
                        resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
                          cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
                        }
                        
                        resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
                          vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id  # Implicit dependency
                          cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
                        }
2. Explicit Dependencies (using depends_on)

                        resource "null_resource" "example" {
                          depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.bucket]
                        }



Best Practices:
Prefer implicit over explicit dependencies.

Use depends_on only when there's no reference but a real dependency.

Keep resources modular and clear to reduce dependency complexity.
