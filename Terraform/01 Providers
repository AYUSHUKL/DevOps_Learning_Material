What is a Provider?
A provider in Terraform is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with APIs of external platforms such as AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, GitHub, local system, etc.

ðŸ’¡ Think of it as the "bridge" between Terraform and your infrastructure platform.

   Syntax

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}


Multiple providers


provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us"
  region = "us-west-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "eu"
  region = "eu-west-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "us_server" {
  provider = aws.us
  ...
}

resource "aws_instance" "eu_server" {
  provider = aws.eu
  ...
}
